                    <div class="w3-padding-32">
                        <p>There isn't really much to tell you about me. I live a very simple life at home in my parent's house. Its more like my own house, because they are never around. Most of the time, my parents are out working for days at a time. They sometimes fill me in on what they do, but they keep changing jobs or duties, and its....hard to keep up. I just nod along and then forget about it. (Hopefully they're not reading this, that would be embarassing.)</p>
                        <p>My parents pay me to stay at home and keep their house going while they are away, so to put it another way, I am paid to sit on my butt and watch TV all day.</p>
                        <p>If you are ever lucky enough to meet me in person, and you don't know how to impress me, you can't go wrong with a hug or a cuddle. I love cuddles so much. That nice warm feeling when someone has their arms around you, even just for a moment. It's what I live for, and makes a lot of things more tolerable.</p>
